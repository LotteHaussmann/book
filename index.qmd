# Preface {.unnumbered}

Here you can read something about my PhD project. The @sec-intro provides an overview and introduction to my topic. @sec-paper1 deals with the unequal access to digital media. The next @sec-paper2 deals with the question of how loneliness and social isolation are connected. The last @sec-paper3 presents a short experiment.

Very nice! I think you have a quite advanced book already. Well done.

1) It can be helpful if all images were stored inside a subfolder,
for example, the one already available "img".

2) Is it intentional that you work in Visual mode rather than in the Source?

If unintentional, you may change the default setting from inside the file

_quarto.yml whereby you either delete line 38 entirely (editor type) or change the argument to
editor: source

3) The epub book format is not generated yet. For that there are some additional things to set up first. Please check online. 

4) Generally, I would clean the work directory before deploying the book. Meaning redundant files such as summary.qmd, which is not a chapter in the book yet, will take up space on the online repository (where you 
deploy the book and also on GitHub). Since those repositories are free they also come with a storage space limitation. So, deploying unnecessary files will clutter and take up space.---->
