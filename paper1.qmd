# Access and use of (social) media {#sec-paper1}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to understand the connection between media use and loneliness, the first step should be to look at how young people have access to media in the first place and how they then use it. Inadequate digital equipment or lack of access to the Internet can affect a young person's ability to participate in online education, to search for information and resources, or to network with peers and like-minded people [@yates2015]. These factors can affect their education, their opportunities in the labour market and their overall social inclusion (ibid.). Where there is such unequal access to the digital world, social exclusion occurs [@thege2021] .People are systematically excluded because of their socio-economic background. Adolescents are a special group, as young people cannot decide about their own resources, instead they are dependent on parents, caregivers, and institutions [@goosby2013]. To answer the research question: What are the systematic differences in access to and use of (social) media among young people in Luxembourg, a cluster analysis is carried out with the help of the Youth Survey Luxembourg 2024. In this context, the influence of socio-economic background, level of education, migration background, age, and household composition, among others, will be considered.
